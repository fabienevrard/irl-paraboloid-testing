This is a testing suite for the polyhedron-paraboloid intersection routines of the [Interface Reconstruction Library](https://github.com/fabienevrard/interface-reconstruction-library/tree/paraboloid_cutting). 

Instructions to compile and execute this code can be found [here](https://github.com/fabienevrard/interface-reconstruction-library/blob/paraboloid_cutting/docs/markdown/paraboloid-polytope_intersection.md).
